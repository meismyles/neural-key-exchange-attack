## Parallel Geometric Attack on Neural Key Exchange Protocol

This C program implements a parallel geometric attack using MPI on the Kanter-Kinzel-Kanter (KKK) secret key exchange protocol that uses artificial neural networks.

There are 2 variations of attack:

1. Online attack: where an attacker executes in parallel with the protocol.
2. Offline attack: where an attacker is given a record of public trace of the protocol.
